# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript 🚀

## Overview 📚

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building efficient and scalable software solutions.


## Data Structures 🏗️

### Arrays 📊

Arrays are collections of elements, each identified by an index or a key.

### Linked Lists 🔗

Linked Lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next in the sequence.

### Stacks 📚

Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end.

### Queues 🚶

Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Trees 🌳

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root element and branching nodes.

### Graphs 🌐

Graphs consist of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between entities.

### Hash Tables 🗃️

Hash Tables use a hash function to map keys to indices, allowing efficient data retrieval.

## Algorithms ⚙️

### Searching 🔍

Searching algorithms find the position of a target element in a collection.

### Sorting 🔄

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order.

### Recursion ↩️

Recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem.

### Dynamic Programming 🧠

Dynamic Programming optimizes solutions by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.
